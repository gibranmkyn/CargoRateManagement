# Design Hypotheses — Teleport OS Vendor

### HMW-V01: How might we adapt the vendor's job list table to work on 768px tablet screens?
**Options:** A) Horizontal scroll table, B) Condensed table (drop Route, stack Customer/Shipment), C) Card list
**Decision:** B) Condensed table — drop Route column (available in detail), stack Customer+Shipment into one cell. Status and Cost always visible. Still a table.

### HMW-V02: How might we order sections on the vendor's job detail page for reconciliation-first workflow?
**Options:** A) Operations first (Route → Cargo → Fees), B) Fees first (Fees → Route + Cargo), C) Split view (Fees left, context right)
**Decision:** B) Fees first — lead with reconciliation data. Vendor already knows the route. Status Action Bar → Fees → Route + Cargo → Proofs → Activity Log.
